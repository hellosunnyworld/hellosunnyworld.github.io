    Hello! I am a first-year Ph.D. in Computer Science at Purdue University, advised by Prof. [Joseph Campbell](https://joe-campbell.github.io/website/). Previously I obtained my M.S. degree in Robotics ([MSR](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/education/academic-programs/master-of-science-robotics/)) at Carnegie Mellon University under Prof. [Katia Sycara](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VWv6a9kAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), collaborating with Honda Research Institute. I work on *single/multi-agent Reinforcement Learning* (**RL**) utilizing **LLM** to **train AI agents with humanlike acting and learning habits**, improving time and resource efficiency and robustness of RL. My areas of interest encompass *human-value aligned RL (such as RLHF, RLAIF), reward specification, multi-agent collaboration analogous to human teamwork, human-in-the-loop interaction and adaptation*, and so on. My long-term research goal is to **develop AI agents which can not only seamlessly interact with each other, but also with human partners**. 
    
    I earned my bachelor's degree at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, where I had the privilege of conducting research and completing my thesis under the guidance of Prof. [Tin Lun Lam](https://sites.google.com/site/lamtinlun). I was also fortunate to participate in the CMU Robotics Institute Summer Scholars ([RISS](https://riss.ri.cmu.edu/_)) program in 2022, where I worked with Prof. [Sebastian Scherer](https://theairlab.org/team/sebastian/). Here is my [CV](/files/MuhanLin_CV_v2.pdf).
